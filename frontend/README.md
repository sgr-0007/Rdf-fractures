## About the Project

Rdf-fractures is a specialized tool designed to analyze fractures using a specific set of rules and algorithms. This frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the backend logic and datasets for visualizing the fracture analysis results.

The main functionalities include:
- Visualization of fracture data
- User-friendly interaction with the underlying algorithms
- Integration with backend APIs for data analysis

## Technologies Used

The project is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For frontend logic and interactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Axios**: To handle HTTP requests to the backend.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different parts of the application.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React project structure:

```bash
