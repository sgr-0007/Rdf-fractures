## About the Project

The backend of the `Rdf-fractures` project is responsible for processing data related to fractures, running algorithms, and providing the results via API endpoints to the frontend. It is designed to be scalable and robust, offering easy integration with the frontend.

The main features of the backend include:
- Data processing
- API endpoints for data access
- Integration with a database for storing and retrieving results

## Technologies Used

The backend is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend services.
- **Express**: Web framework for handling API requests.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing fracture data and results.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB, simplifying database interactions.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to third-party APIs, if required.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard backend structure:

```bash
backend/
├── controllers/        # API controllers
├── models/             # Database models (Mongoose)
├── routes/             # API routes
├── services/           # Business logic and helper functions
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── app.js              # Main application entry point
├── package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Installation

To get the backend up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- MongoDB installed locally or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgr-0007/Rdf-fractures.git
cd Rdf-fractures/backend
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
## Usage

### Running the Backend Server

To start the backend server locally, use:

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000` by default. Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the server.
